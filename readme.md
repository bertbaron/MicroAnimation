# Arduino Library to play compressed Animations

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available_in_the_Arduino_Library_Manager-2ea44f)](<Link>)

Plays compressed monochrome animations on Adafruit displays. Originally added to be able to play animated Icons from https://animator.wokwi.com/ on small devices like the Arduino Micro. 

## Creating Animations

Animations can be compressed by the [Arduino Animation Compressor](https://bertbaron.github.io/arduino-animation-compressor/)

## Supported Displays

Currently only tested with the SSD1306. Feature/pull requests for other displays are welcome.
